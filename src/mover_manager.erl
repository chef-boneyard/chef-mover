%% <em>States and Transitions</em>
%%
%% <ul>
%% <li> `ready -> working' : when the 'start' message is received.</li>
%% <li> `working -> halting'</li>
%% <ul>
%%     <li> no more orgs available to be processed </li>
%%     <li> fatal error encountered within a worker </li>
%%     <li> all requested orgs are currently processing </li>
%%     <li> a worker could not be started </li>
%% </ul>
%%
%% <li> `halting -> ready' : all workers have stopped </li>
%% </ul>
%%
%% <em>Worker Startup and Replacement</em>
%% <p>
%% Workers are evaluated when current state is `working'. If there are
%% fewer `live_workers' than `max_worker_count' and there are
%% still orgs left to process, another worker is started.
%% </p>
%%
%% <ul>
%% <li> `working' state is signalled every time a worker
%%      terminates with either a `normal' exit or a
%%      `migration_error' exit.
%% </li>
%% <li> `working' state is signalled every time a worker
%%      is started, so that the FSM can determine if more
%%      workers are needed.
%% </li>
%% </ul>
%%
%% <em>Additional Notes</em>
%% <ul>
%% <li>An org is considered as 'processed' (for status reporting) once a worker
%%     for that org has been successfully launched. Regardless of whether or not
%%     the migration succeeds, the persisted state of the org will be set to remove
%%     it from the pool of orgs available for migration.</li>
%%
%% <li>If at any point a worker goes down for a reason we haven't trapped,
%%     or for a specific {error, X} reason that we have trapped,
%%     we will stop replacing workers and allow all current workers to die out
%%     regardless of if there are orgs remaining to process.</li>
%% </ul>
